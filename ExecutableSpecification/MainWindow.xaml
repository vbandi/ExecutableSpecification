        <TextBox AcceptsReturn="True" Grid.Row="1" Margin="8" x:Name="tb_Specification" TextWrapping="Wrap" xml:space="preserve">The application is called "Counter".
The application window is resizable.
There is a button labeled "Click Me" in the middle of the window.
Below the button, there is a text that says "Not clicked yet"
When the user clicks the Button, the text should change to "Clicked 1 times"
If the user clicks the button again, the text should change to indicate the number of times the button has been clicked.
If the user has clicked the button 3 times, the button should be disabled, and the text should change to "That's enough!"

The app supports multiple languages.
The app should also have a button in the lower left corner that toggles the language between English and Hungarian. Pressing this will change every text in the app to the other language (including button labels).
The app should launch in Hungarian.
